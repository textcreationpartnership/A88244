            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>ght to have done; for, that they are bound to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Lawes by their Oath, is out of queſtion, and yet the contrary</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:113959:21"/>
               <hi>practiſed by them, will appear in all ages, as often.</hi> But to put this out of doubt, whoſoever reades the Oath taken by this King, which he himſelf ſets down in his Declaration, (Book Declar. pag. 290, 291.) will find no materiall difference betwixt that which hee took, and that which he ought to have taken, ſaving in that clauſe of paſſing <hi>New Lawes:</hi> But there is enough in that he tooke to prove my aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That he received his Crown by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, which further to prove, I alledge the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> which whoſoever ſeriouſly readeth with his Anſwer to it, ſhall finde it to be a large and abſolute Declaration of a contracted duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him, and his people, <hi>viz. That it was his duty to govern them by Law, and not by his Prerogative Will,</hi> And when his firſt anſwer to their Petition did not pleaſe the Parliament, they preſſed him again, out of <hi>Right,</hi> to give a ſatisfactory one: Which he, out of <hi>Duty</hi> doth, ſaying, <hi>Let right b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> done, as is deſired:</hi> So that this is a clear demonſtration, and enough to prove that there is not only a bare Contract betwixt the King and the People, but alſo that he is bound by duty to grant ſuch Lawes, as they ſhall rationally chooſe, although there were no ſuch Statute, as the 25. of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. which they mention in pag. 268, nor no ſuch clauſes as they ſpeak of, pag. 706, 707, 714. In the Records of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Num:</hi> 44. and <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Num:</hi> 34. and 40.</p>
            <p>Again, it will clearly appear, that there is a contract betwixt the King &amp; his People; yea, and ſuch a one, as ties up all his public of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial actions to be according unto Law, and not according to the rule of his own Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, if we ſeriouſly weigh but the Lawes made, and paſt this preſent Parliament; but eſpecially that for aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the Star-Chamber, and regulating the Councell-Table, the Act for aboliſhing the high Commiſſion Court, two Acts for the levying and preſſing Souldiers and Marriners; and an Act decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring unlawfull and void the late proceedings touching Ship-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, And an Act for preventing vexatious proceedings, touching the order of Knight-hood. And an Act for the free bringing in, and free making of Gun-powder.</p>
            <p>But if all this will not ſerve, let us a little further conſider what the Parliament ſaith, who are the States repreſentative of all the individuals of the State univerſall of <hi>England,</hi> Book Declar. pag. 171. 264. 336. 508, 613. 628. 654. 655. 703. 705. 711. 724. 725. 726 728. 729, 730.</p>

            <p>And they ſay pag. 266. That the King hath not that right to the Towns and Forts in <hi>England,</hi> which the people in generall have to their eſtates, the Towns being no more the Kings own, then the Kingdome is his own: And his Kingdome is no more his own, then his people are his own; And if the King had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in all his Towns, what would become of the Subjects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in their houſes therein! And if he had a propriety in his Kingdom, what would become of the Subjects propriety in their Lands throughout the Kingdom, or of their Liberties, if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie had the ſame right in their perſons, that every Subject hath in their Lands or Goods, and what ſhould become of all the Subjects Intereſts in the Towns and Forts in the Kingdome, and in the Kingdom it ſelf, if his Majeſtie might ſell them, or give them away, or diſpoſe of them at pleaſure, as a particular man may do with his Lands and his Goods; This erroneous Maxime being infuſed in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yea, and in their Declaration of the 19. of <hi>May,</hi> 1642. page <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 7. they tell us, that this Law is as old as the Kingdome, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Kingdom muſt not be without a meanes to preſerve it ſelfe, which, that it might be done without confuſion (ſay they) this Nation hath entruſted certain hands with a power, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide in an orderly and regular way for the good and ſafety of the whole, which power by the conſtitution of this Kingdome, is in his Majeſty, and in his Parliament together.</p>
            <p>Yet ſince the Prince being but one perſon, is more ſubject to accidents of nature and chance, whereby the Common-wealth may be deprived of the fruit of that Truſt which was in part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him, in caſes of ſuch neceſſity, that the <hi>Kingdome</hi> may not be inforced preſently to return to its firſt principall, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man left to do what is aright in his own eyes, without either guide or rule, the wiſdome of this State hath intruſted the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> with a power to ſupply what ſhall bee wanting on the part of the Prince, as is evident by the conſtant cuſtome and practice thereof, in caſes of nonage, <hi>naturall diſability and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> and the like reaſon doth and muſt hold for the exerciſe of the ſame power, in ſuch caſes where the <hi>Royall Truſt</hi> cannot bee, or is not diſcharged, and that the Kingdome runs an evident and eminent danger thereby; which danger, having been declared by the <hi>Lords and Commons in Parliament,</hi> there needs not the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any perſon or Court to affirme, nor is it in the power of any perſon or Court to revoke that judgment (for as they well ſay in their Declaration of the 26. of <hi>May,</hi> 1642. page 281.) it is not agreeable to <hi>reaſon or conſcience,</hi> that it ſhould be otherwiſe, ſeeing men ſhould be put upon an impoſſibility of knowing their duty, if the Judgment of the higheſt Court ſhould not be a rule and guide to them.</p>
            <p>And if the Judgment therefore ſhould be followed, where the queſtion is, <hi>who is King,</hi> (as before in that <hi>Declaration,</hi> they have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113959:23"/>
rpoved it ought) much more, <hi>what is the beſt ſervice of the King and Kingdome,</hi> and therefore thoſe that ſhall guide themſelves by the judgment of <hi>Parliament,</hi> ought, what ever happen, to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and free from all account and penalties upon the grounds, and equity of this very Statute of 11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. Chap. 1.</p>
            <p>And again, page 697. (they ſay, very rationally,) There muſt be a Judge of the queſtion wherein the ſafety of the Kingdome depends (for it muſt not lie undetermined.) And if then there be not an agreement betwixt his Majeſty and the Parliament, either his Majeſty muſt be Judge againſt his Parliament, or the Parliament without his Majeſty: It is unſound and irrationall to give it to his Majeſtie, who out of the Courts is not Judge of the leaſt dammage, or treſpaſſe done to the leaſt of his Subjects, but the Parliament is the Repreſentative Body of the whole Kingdome, and therefore the abſolute proper and legall Judge. Beſides, If his Majeſty (in the difference of Opinions) ſhould be Judge, he ſhould be Judge in his own caſe, but the Parliament ſhould be Judges between his Majeſty and the Kingdome: And if his Majeſty ſhould be Judge, hee ſhould be Judge out of his Courts; yea, and againſt his higheſt Court, which he never is (nor can be) but the Parliament ſhould only judge, without his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties perſonall conſent, which as a Court of Judicature it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes doth, and all other Courts as well as it.</p>
            <p>Therefore if the King be for the Kingdome, and not the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for the King; And if the Kingdome beſt knowes what is for its own good and preſervation, and the Parliament be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Body of the Kingdome; It is eaſie to judge who in this caſe ſhould be Judge, And therefore the Parliament are bound in duty to thoſe that truſt them, to ſee that the king diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe aright of his truſt, being that right that the King hath as King, in the things he enjoyes, is of a different nature, and for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ends, to the right of propriety which a particular man hath in his Goods and Lands, &amp;c. That of propriety is a right of propriety, which a particular man may diſpoſe of, as hee pleaſeth according to his own diſcretion for his own advantage, ſo it bee not contrary to the publike good; but the right of the King is only a right of truſt, which he is to mannage in ſuch wayes, and by ſuch Councels as the Law doth direct, and only for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:113959:24"/>
good, and not to his private advantages, nor to the prejudice of any mans particular Intereſts, much leſſe of the Publike, page 700. And therefore (ſay they) page 687. <hi>The King hath not the like liberty in diſpoſing of his own perſon, or of the perſons of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (in reſpect of the Interest the Kingdome hath in them) as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man may have.</hi>
            </p>

That <hi>notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, they are bound to ſee it managed, according to the true intent &amp; condition therof;</hi> (for no man doth nor can give a power to deſtroy himſelf) and therefore ſay they, <hi>If we ſhould ſay the King hath in the Government of his People, Superiors,</hi> to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to that inference from hence drawn, and naturally flowing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the premiſes, and proved by your firſt Pofition, laid down in the fore-cited page, 726. which is, <hi>That the Parliament hath a power in declaring Law, in particular caſes in queſtion before them,</hi> and that which is ſo declared by the High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being the higheſt Court of Judicature, ought not afterwards to be queſtioned by his Majeſty, or any of his Subjects, for that there lyeth no Appeal from them, to any Perſon or Court whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; ſo that the right and ſafety both of King and People, ſhal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> for its interpretation upon the Courts of Juſtice, which are the competent Judges thereof, and not upon the pleaſure and interpretation of private perſons, or of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, in a private capacity. <hi>Good-night (my Lords)</hi> unleſſe you will make a little more buzling, and ſo make the ſtink a little more hot in the Noſtrils of all men that have the uſe of their ſences, before your ſnuffe go cleer out, the which if you do, it will (I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) but cauſe it to go out with a witneſſe.</p>

Oh, ye <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> what neede have you to be combined together to maintaine your common intereſt againſt theſe uſurping cruel and mercileſſe Lords, and to take ſpeciall heede that by their charmes and Syren-like ſongs; you be not divided about toyes, into factions, to your own deſtruction, and ruine, that being vifibly the game (to the eyes of rationall men) which they and their agents have now to play, and by the foote you may eaſily judge what the beare is.</p>
            <p>But now after this neceſſitated digreſſion; let us returne back to the King, and to his forfeiting his truſt, which is to protect his people from violence, and wrong, and governe them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to law. Let us conſider what his, and our ſupreame legall, and rightfull Judges; <hi>The Houſe of Commons, the State repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of England;</hi> in their Petition, and Remonſtrance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him at <hi>Hampton Court</hi> (15. December 1642. and which begins book declaration, pag. 1. and ends pag. 21.) Say: And we ſhall cleerly finde that they evidently make plaine to the King, and the whole Kingdome; That his 17. yeers raigne was filled up with a conſtant continnued Act of violating the Lawes of the Kingdome, and the Liberties of his people. Yes, in pag. 491. They plainly ſay that before this Parliament the Lawes were no defence nor protection of any mans right: all was ſubject to will and power, which impoſed what payments they thought fit, to draine the ſubjects purſes, and they who yeelded and complyed; were countenanced, and advanced: and all others, diſgraced, and kept under; that ſo mens minds made poore and baſe, and their liberties loſt and gone; they might be ready to let go their religion, And the reſt of the regall ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall deſignes; there moſt acutely anatomiſed, to which I referr the reader, as a peece extraordinary much worth the reading.</p>
            <p>And though the <hi>King</hi> (this Parliament) ſigned divers good Lawes as though he intended to turne over a new leafe; Yet the <hi>Parliament</hi> tell him plainly, that even in or about the time, of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe bills; ſome deſigne or other hath been on foote, which if it had taken effect, would not onely have deprived us of the fruits of thoſe bills, but would have reduced us to a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of confuſion then that wherein the <hi>Parliament</hi> found us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Yea, and they plainly declare, that the King had a finger in the Iriſh Rebellion: for all his many ſolemn proteſtations to the contrary: and that at the very begining, by his immediate warrant; licenſed Commanders to go over to them, and hindred ſupplies from going to ſuppreſſe them, pag. 70. 98. 116. 567. 568. 569. 622.</p>
            <p>Yea, and though he were ſo quick againſt the Scots, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately (upon their declaring themſelves to maintaine their rights) to proclaime them traytors; yet notwithſtanding (though the King vowed and proteſted that his ſoule abhorred the Iriſh Rebellion;) it was about three moneths before the <hi>Parliament</hi> could get him to proclaime them traytors: And when he was by them forced to proclaime them traytors; His <hi>Majeſty</hi> gave ſpeciall Command, that, but forty of them ſhould be printed, and not one of them publiſhed till farther directions given by his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> pag. 567.</p>
            <p>Yea, and beſides all this; contrary to his Oath; he refuſeth to paſſe the bill for the <hi>Militia</hi> although it was often preſt upon him by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as the onely way and meanes to ſettle and preſerve the peace of the Kingdome: and alſo with-drawes himſelfe from the <hi>Parliament;</hi> with a defigne to levy warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, whereupon for the diſcharge of their duty and truſt, and the preſervation of the Kingdome, the 20. <hi>May</hi> 1642. book declar. pag. 259. they paſt three votes, <hi>viz.</hi>

And when they came to him, they told him, the Common-wealth had conceived ſo irreconcileable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes of his government, the particulars whereof had been ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the generall Aſſembly at <hi>London,</hi> that it was reſolved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to endure him as King any longer: That, (notwithſtanding) thoſe diſlikes had not extended ſo far, as for his ſake to exclude his iſſue; but that with univerſall applauſe, and joy, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth had in Parliament elected his eldeſt ſonne, the Lord <hi>Edward,</hi> for King. They finally told him, that unleſſe he did of himſelfe renounce his Crown and Scepter; the people would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endure him, nor any of his children, as their Soveraigne: but diſclaiming all Homage and Fealty, would elect ſome other for King, not of the Blood.</q>

            <p>The King ſeeing it would be no better; amongſt other things told them, <q>That he ſorrowed much, that the people of the Kingdom were ſo exaſperated againſt him, as that they ſhould utterly abhorre his (any longer) rule and ſoveraignty; and therefore he beſought all there preſent, to forgive him; and gave them thanks for chuſing his eldeſt ſonne to be their King, which was greatly to his good liking, that he was ſo gracious in their ſight.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon they proceeded to the ſhort Ceremony of his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation,</hi> which principally conſiſted in the ſurrender of his <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi> and <hi>Enſignes</hi> of <hi>Majeſty</hi> to the uſe of his ſon the new King.

            <p>We will only ſpeak two or three words to one thing, more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned in her Petition; and to another thing not mentioned at all in her Petition, very requiſite to be taken notice of, in the manner of his Tryall; which is, That by Law it ought to have been publike.</p>
            <p>Now for the firſt of theſe, which is the illegallity of all their Warrants, they committed him by; learned and grave Sir <hi>Edward Cooke,</hi> in his moſt execllent, worthy, and pretious Expoſition of the 29. <hi>Chapter of Magna Charta, his</hi> 2. <hi>Part.

            <p>Now ſeeing that no man can be taken, arreſted, attached or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, but by due proceſſe of Law, and according to the Law of the Land, theſe concluſions hereupon do follow,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that a commitment by lawfull Warrant, either in deed, or in law, is accounted in law, due proceſſe, or proceeding of Law; and by the Law of the Land, as well as by proceſſe, by force of the Kings Writ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he, or they, which do commit them, have lawfull authority.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that this <hi>Warrant</hi> or <hi>Mittimus</hi> be lawfull, and that muſt be in writing, under his hand and ſeale.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the cauſe muſt be contained in the Warrant; as for Treaſon, Fellony, &amp;c. or for ſuſpition of Treaſon, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Fellony, &amp;c. Otherwiſe, if the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> contain no cauſe at all <hi>[it is illegall]</hi> And if the priſoner eſcape, it is no offence at all; Whereas, if the <hi>Mittimus</hi> contained the cauſe; the eſcape were Treaſon or Fellony, though he were not guilty of the offence: and therefore, for the Kings benefit, and that the priſoner may be the more ſafely kept; the <hi>Mittimus</hi> ought to contain the cauſe.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the <hi>Warrant</hi> or <hi>Mittimus</hi> containing a lawfull cauſe, ought to have a lawfull concluſion, <hi>viz. and him ſafely to keep, until he be delivered by Law, &amp;c.</hi> and not untill the party committing doth further order; And this doth evidently appear by the Writs

               <hi>Kingdome, is alwayes private, and none but the Members or Officers of either Houſe admitted to their conſultations and debates. But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as the Parliament is a Court of Juſtice, to puniſh Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; ſo the proceedings of both, or either Houſe are alwayes pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as appears by the late Tryall of the Earle of</hi> Strafford, <hi>in</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall, <hi>and infinite other preſidents of antient and preſent time;</hi>

            <p>To which, I may adde, the Tryall of <hi>William Laud,</hi> late <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of</hi> Canterbury. And this practice is ſuitable to what we read in Scripture; that among <hi>the Iewes, the Iudges ſate openly in the City Gates,</hi> the moſt publike place of all. And truly, he or they that will not ſuffer Juſtice to be executed. and adminiſtred openly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayes their own guiltineſſe; and do thereby acknowledge, that they are aſhamed of their cauſe. For, ſaith Chriſt, John 3. 20, 21. <hi>Every one that doth evill, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leaſt his deeds ſhould be reproved (or diſcovered;) but he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſo far were the Lords, from this juſt way, of permitting Lieutenant Col. <hi>Lilburn,</hi> a publike tryall; that the firſt time hee came before them, <hi>Iune</hi> 11. 1646. After he was come into the Houſe, ſome of his friends, and ſome ſtrangers ſtept in, as by Law and Juſtice they might; But the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> (as Speaker of that Houſe) commanded them all to withdraw, which they were forced to doe.</p>
            <p>And this I averre, not by hear-ſay, but out of knowledge. And the ſecond time he came before them, which was 23 <hi>Iune</hi> 1646. It was little otherwiſe, his friends being turned out of doores, though ſome of his enemies, ſcoffers, and deriders, were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſtay: And the third time, which was upon the 11. <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1646; as I underſtand, he had much adoe with the dore-keepers, to get his wife to be admitted in; though a great many of the Sheriffes Sharks and Caterpillars, that accompany the Hang-man to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn, the day he doth execution, were freely admitted; &amp; <hi>Hounſcot</hi> the <hi>tyrannicall Prelates old-cruell Catchpole,</hi> and now the <hi>Lords ſpeciall Darling, and Favourite,</hi> a man <hi>tranſcendent in baſeneſſe, and wickedneſſe,</hi> and therefore more fit ſor their Lordſhips, with ſome others of their own creatures, were admitted in, as parties fit to

               <hi>Excellent Peeres, I beſeech you hearken to my words, and give me your counſell. At my ſailing into Normandy, I leſt England to the government of</hi> ODO MY BROTHER, <hi>who</hi> (a little further in his ſpeech hee ſaith) <hi>hath greatly oppreſſed England, ſpoyling the Churches of land and rents, hath made them naked of Ornaments, given by our predeceſſors, and hath ſeduced my Knights, with purpoſe to train them over the Alps, who ought to defend the land againſt the Nations of Scots, Danes, Iriſh, and other enemies over-ſtrong for me.</hi> And (a little below that) <hi>my brother,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to whom I committed the whole kingdom, violently plucketh away their goods, cruelly grindeth the poore; and, with a vain hope, ſtealeth away my Knights from me, and by oppreſſion hath exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the whole land with unjuſt taxations. Conſider therefore, moſt NOBLE LORDS, and give mee, I pray you, your advice, what is herein to be done: And in concluſion the King adjudged him to priſon, yet not as a Biſhop,</hi> (who then, it ſeemes, had large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:113959:52"/>
but as an Earl, ſubject to the lawes and cenſure of his King. Which accordingly (ſaith <hi>Speed) was done, upon ſeizure of eſtate, this Prelate was whoſe found ſo well lined in purſe, that his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that here you have the true ſtory of the ſubverſion of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manner of Parliaments, &amp; the ancient Lawes and Liberties of Government of this Kingdome, and a Law innovated, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, flowing meerly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the will of a Baſtard, Thief, Robber &amp; tirant. You have here alſo a true Declaration of the original riſe of the pretended legiſlative power of <hi>Earles, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Barons,</hi> the <hi>Peers, Competitors, and truſty and wel-beloved Couſins, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Counſellors</hi> of our <hi>Kings,</hi> which was meerly and only from the wills and pleaſures of this cruell and bloudy Tyrant, and his Succeſſors; And no better claime have our preſent houſe of Peers either for their legiſlative power, or judicative power, then this, as is cleerly manifeſt by their own fore-mentioned Declaration, cited pag. 45. and therefore ſay I, are no legall Judicature at all, nor have no true legiſlative, or law-making power at all in them; having never in the leaſt derived it from the people, the true legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaters and fountain of power; from whom only, and alone, muſt be fetched all derivative power, that either will or can be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med juſt: And therfore the Lords challenging all the power they have by their bloud, and deriving it from no other fountain but the <hi>Kings Letters-Pattents,</hi> flowing meerly from his <hi>will &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> I groundedly conclude, they have thereby no <hi>judicative po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer;</hi> no, nor <hi>legiſlative power</hi> at all in them: for the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give more to them, then he himſelf hath; and he hath neither of theſe powers, <hi>(viz.</hi> a <hi>judicative power,</hi> nor a <hi>legiſlative power)</hi> inherent in him; as is ſtrongly, undeniably, and unanſwerably proved before, in pag. 43<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 44, 46, 47, 60, 61.</p>
            <p>And therefore away with the pretended power of the Lords; up with it by the roots, and let them ſit no longer as they do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they will put themſelves upon the love of their Country, to be freely therby choſen as their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Read the Hiſtories of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, and you ſhall eaſily find, that the pride and contention of thoſe <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> that were called Lords amongſt themſelves, was no ſmall cauſe of the loſing of this Kingdome to that Tyrant: for ſaith <hi>Speed, fol.</hi> 409. <hi>After the Normans had ſlain King</hi> Harold, <hi>and overthrown his Army, the two great Earles of</hi> Yorkſhire, <hi>and</hi> Cheſhire, Morcar <hi>and</hi> Edwine <hi>coming to</hi> London, <hi>where the</hi> Londoners, <hi>&amp;c. would gladly have ſet up</hi> Edgar Atheling <hi>the true Heire to the Crown, to have been their Captain Generall, to have defended them from the powerfull Norman Invaders, who now was exceedingly fleſhed with his victory, and now likely to over-run the whole Land: yet ſuch was the pride and baeſeneſſe of theſe two great Lords, that the miſery, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, and fearfull eſtate of their native Country, could not diſſwade from their ambition, plotting ſecretly to get the Crown to themſelvs, which hindered that wiſe and noble deſign, and totally loſt their native Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O COMMONS OF ENGLAND, therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of them, and have a jealous eye over them; and take heed, that when it comes to the pinch, they ſerve you not ſuch another trick again.</p>
            <p>For I am ſure, their intereſt is not yours, nor the publikes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it conſiſtent with their ends, that you ſhould enjoy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or your undeniable and juſt rights, liberties, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>And well to this purpoſe, ſaith <hi>Daniel</hi> (pag. 36.) <q>That after the Biſhops and the Clergy had ſhewed their averſneſſe, to the erecting of that probable meanes that was propounded to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the theeviſh invader) the Nobility, conſidering they were ſo born, and muſt have a King (and therefore conſidering of his power) made them ſtrive, and run head-long, who ſhould bee the firſt to pre-occupate the grace of ſervitude, and intrude them into forraign ſubjection.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that the poor Commons (like a ſtrong veſſell, that ſaith hee

By meanes of which they had ſuch vaſt power in the kingdome, (having then at their beck all the chiefe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Free-holders of <hi>England,</hi> that uſed to wait upon them in <hi>blew Jackets:</hi> ſo that they were upon any diſcontent able to combine againſt their Kings, their abſolute creators, and hold their noſes to the grind-ſtone, and rather give a Law unto them, then receive a law from them: in which great ſtreits our former Kings, for curbing the greatneſſe of theſe their meere creatures, now grown inſolent; were forced to give new Charters, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and Writs unto the Commons (then generally abſolute vaſſals,) to chooſe ſo many Knights and Burgeſles, as they in their own breaſts ſhould think fit to be able, by joyning with them, to curb their potent and inſolent Lords, or truſty and well-beloved Couſins, which was all the end they firſt called the Commons together for; yet this good came out of it, that by degrees the Commons came to underſtand in a greater meaſure, their rights, and to know their own power and ſtrength. By means of which, with much ſtruggling, we in this age come to enjoy what wee have, by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> and the good and juſt Lawes made this preſent Parliament, &amp;c. which yet is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing nigh ſo much as by right we ought to enjoy: For the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Author of the book called, <hi>The manner of holding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments in England,</hi> as 20, 21. pages declares plainly, that <hi>in times by-paſt, there was neither Biſhop, Earle nor Baron; and yet even then Kings kept Parliaments.

            </p>
            <p>And before the Conqueſt he poſitively declares, <hi>it was a right, that all things which are to be affirmed or informed, granted or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, or to be done by the Parliament, muſt be granted by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty of the Parliament; who</hi> (he affirmes) <hi>might refuſe (though ſummoned) to come to Parliament, in caſe the King did not governe them as he ought, unto whom it was lawfull in particular to point out the Articles in which he miſgoverned them.</hi>
